    <p><b>Adding to the Timeline</b></p>
    <p>Click on the workbench to add a card. This represents your scene. You'll be prompted to fill in some text, and perhaps put in an image. To edit any previously created card, double click on it.</p>

    <p><b>Modes</b></p>
    <p>There are four options at the top of the page, also accessible by hotkeys. They help you fiddle with the scenes on your timeline.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Select (S) - to select just one item. For:
            <ul>
                <li>Deleting cards</li>
                <li>Cut/Copy/Paste</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li>Multiselect (M) - select multiple items. For:
        <ul>
            <li>Deleting cards</li>
            <li>Dragging multiple cards at once</li>
            <li>Cut/Copy/Paste</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Chaining - (C) link cards together. This is the meat of Timeline Space!
            <ul>
                <li>Click one card, then another, and a chain will appear between them.</li>
                <li>Click one card and add another, and a chain will be created linking your new card.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Tagging (T) - tag your cards and chains. This allows you to identify which agents are in this event.
            <ul>
                <li>Add tags using the Manage Tags popup</li>
                <li>Select a tag to apply to cards and chains in the timeline. This can be done via the popup, or by pressing keys 1 - 9.</li>
                <li>Click to toggle the tag on each card and chain.</li>
            </ul></li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Markers</b></p>
    <p>Markers are draggable only on the axis on which they were created. Markers made by pressing the top bar move horizontally, and vice-versa.</p>
    <p>To destroy a marker, drag it off the screen to the left or to the top</p>

    <p><b>Dragging</b> (D)</p>
    <p>Timelines are fluid things and you'll often need to make more space for events you'd forgotten about. You can drag events at any point to create room. You can also drag markers around.</p>
    <p>You can drag linked events by holding down <i><u>Ctrl</u></i> or <i><u>Command</u></i>.</p>
    <p>You can also drag both linked events and later markers when dragging by holding down <i><u>Shift</u></i>.</p>

    <p><b>Tags</b></p>
    <p>Events, Timelines, Images and Chains can all be tagged. This allows you to quickly visually track what is happening where in your timeline.</p>
    <p>Tags are hotkeyed with numbers 1-9 to make selection easier as you develop your timeline. Use 0 to deselect all tags so you can clear a card or chain.</p>
